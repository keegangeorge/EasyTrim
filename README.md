# EasyTrim


Easy Trim is an Android application intended to facilitate the trimming of a boat. Easy Trim will keep track of the boat's trim angle at specific speeds for fast and easy adjustments to the trim. 

## Features
#### Boat Trimming
After calibration, view a speedometer that displays your current speed and the amount of trim necessary for the boat. The application will prompt you with an up or down arrow whether to increase or decrease your boat's trim angle.

#### Statistics
View statistics based on your usage such as your top speed.
